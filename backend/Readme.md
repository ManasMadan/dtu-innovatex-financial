### Financial Log Collection and Management
- *Log Data Storage:* Financial transaction logs are collected, securely stored using IPFS, and organized for efficient retrieval and analysis.
- *Data Ingestion:* The backend provides mechanisms for ingesting financial log data from diverse sources, ensuring compatibility and data integrity.
- *Data Retention:* Define data retention policies to manage the storage of financial log data, ensuring compliance with financial regulations and data protection laws.

### Real-time Fraud Detection Analysis
- *Machine Learning Models:* Implement advanced machine learning algorithms (XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, and MLPRegressor) to detect anomalies and identify fraud patterns in real-time.
- *Risk Assessment:* Utilize the ML model to predict risk percentages for entered logs, providing a continuous output from 0 to 1 (1 being most risky, 0 being least risky).
- *Alerting System:* Create an alerting system that triggers notifications when potential fraudulent activities or policy violations are detected.

### API and Data Access
- *RESTful APIs:* Provide secure RESTful APIs for the frontend to access financial log data, fraud detection results, and system configuration settings.
- *User Authentication:* Implement robust user authentication and authorization mechanisms for API access, ensuring data privacy and security.
- *Data Visualization:* Offer APIs for data visualization tools to fetch real-time financial insights and generate reports for monitoring and investigation purposes.

### Security Measures
- *Encryption:* Implement strong encryption for sensitive data both at rest and in transit.
- *Access Control:* Utilize smart contracts for executing access control logic, ensuring only authorized parties can retrieve or modify specific data stored on IPFS.
- *Network Security:* Implement firewalls, network segmentation, and strict access controls to protect the private network from external threats.

This backend system ensures a secure, reliable, and efficient approach to detecting and managing fraudulent activities in financial environments, leveraging the benefits of blockchain, IPFS, and advanced machine learningÂ techniques.
